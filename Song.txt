Are you running 'round in circles with no place to go?
Is there a person in the mirror you don't even know?
Someone still sees who you are, yeah
Were you the kid that was a dreamer, now you don't believe?
Are you the lock that got so broken, now you lost the key?

To anyone who ever lost your way
To everyone who ever felt ashamed
Here's a song for all the broken hearted
